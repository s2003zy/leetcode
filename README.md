#Why I Did This ?

There are already has plenty of awesome leetCode answer on the GitHub.

###First Reason
The First Reason is that I find that Most of the them.Just simply put the source code to the GitHub
without any organiztion.And I think I could do little better than that.

###Second Reason
The Second Reason is that most of Answer use single programing
language.So I want organize all the language which the leetcode
supported(including c++ , java , python) 

###Third Reason
The Third Reason is that I also want to Learn Form Coding to improve my
coding ability.^_^
